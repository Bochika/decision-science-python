# Decision Making with Satellite Data

## Overview
This repository presents an applied approach to decision-making supported by satellite data.
Using Landsat imagery and Python-based analysis, the project focuses on estimating and analyzing
the temporal evolution of surface water bodies in order to generate information relevant for
environmental monitoring and territorial decision-making.

Rather than treating satellite data as an end in itself, the emphasis is placed on how quantitative
results derived from remote sensing can inform decisions under uncertainty.

## Case Study
**Laguna de Fúquene (Colombia)**

The repository includes a case study centered on the Laguna de Fúquene, where satellite imagery is
used to estimate changes in surface water area over time. The results illustrate how spatial and
temporal patterns can support decisions related to environmental management and planning.

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured workflow:

- Definition of the decision context and analytical objectives  
- Delimitation of the Area of Interest (AOI)  
- Selection and preprocessing of satellite imagery (Landsat)  
- Identification and classification of water surfaces  
- Estimation of surface water area  
- Temporal comparison and interpretation of results  
- Discussion of implications for decision-making

Each notebook is designed to build upon the previous one, forming a coherent analytical narrative
from problem definition to decision-relevant insights.

## Data Sources
- Landsat satellite imagery  
- Derived spatial and temporal metrics of surface water extent  

All data processing steps are documented within the notebooks.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Landsat satellite imagery  
- Geospatial analysis libraries  

## Decision-Oriented Perspective
The core objective of this project is to demonstrate how satellite-derived indicators can be
translated into actionable information. The analysis highlights how changes in surface water area
can inform monitoring strategies, environmental assessments, and planning decisions.
