    "\n",
    "Laguna de Fúquene is one of the most important water bodies in the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and has undergone significant changes in its surface extent over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze the temporal evolution of surface water extent using Earth Observation (EO) data, prioritizing a reproducible workflow and a critical interpretation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than producing a definitive estimate of the lagoon’s area, this analysis focuses on understanding how satellite data, their inherent limitations, and methodological decisions influence the estimates obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a decision-making perspective, this project examines how satellite-derived indicators and their uncertainty condition the type of conclusions that can be drawn for environmental monitoring and territorial management."

    "\n",
    "Earth Observation (EO) refers to the use of satellite, aerial, or ground-based sensors to monitor physical processes on the Earth’s surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, EO is used to:\n",
    "- Detect surface water through spectral information\n",
    "- Analyze spatial and temporal changes\n",
    "- Evaluate the quality and reliability of historical satellite data\n",
    "\n",
    "EO does not provide exact values, but rather estimates that depend on sensor characteristics, spatial resolution, temporal coverage, and processing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, EO is treated as a decision-support tool rather than a source of absolute truth, emphasizing its role in comparative analysis and long-term trend evaluation."

    "\n",
    "Although more recent sensors such as Sentinel-2 offer higher spatial resolution, this project prioritizes temporal consistency over spatial detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reasons for selecting Landsat are:\n",
    "- Continuous temporal coverage since 1984\n",
    "- Comparability between years without changing sensors\n",
    "- Reduction of inconsistencies introduced by instrumental differences\n",
    "- Suitability for long-term trend analysis\n",
