    "## Problem Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laguna de Fúquene is one of the most important wetland systems in the Andean region of Colombia. Over recent decades, the lagoon has experienced significant ecological and hydrological stress, driven by a combination of climatic variability and anthropogenic pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding long-term changes in the surface water extent of the lagoon is critical for environmental monitoring, water resource management, and policy decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on quantifying and analyzing the long-term stability of the lagoon's surface water area and exploring its relationship with precipitation patterns.\n"

    "1. How has the surface water area of the Laguna de Fúquene evolved over the last four decades?\n",
    "2. Is there a detectable long-term trend or structural change in water surface stability?\n",
    "3. How does precipitation variability relate to observed changes in surface water extent?\n",
    "4. Are satellite-derived trends consistent across independent data sources?\n"

    "- Satellite-derived classifications may contain uncertainty due to cloud cover and sensor limitations.\n",
    "- The analysis does not explicitly model human interventions such as water extraction or land-use change.\n",
    "- Results should be interpreted as indicative of long-term trends rather than precise hydrological measurements.\n"
